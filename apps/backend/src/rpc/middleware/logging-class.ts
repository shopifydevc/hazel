 * Logging middleware that logs all incoming RPC requests and their results.
 *
 * This middleware:
 * 1. Logs the RPC method name when a request is received
 * 2. Executes the handler
 * 3. Logs the result (success or failure) with annotations
 *
 * This provides the same logging behavior as HttpMiddleware.logger for HTTP API requests.
 *
 * Usage in RPC group:
 * ```typescript
 * const MyRpcs = RpcGroup.make(
 *   Rpc.make("MyMethod", { ... })
 * ).middleware(RpcLoggingMiddleware)
 * ```
